=============================
SpaceShip.java - Contains a abstract class SpaceShip, and general methods of ships.
SpaceShipFactory.java - Contains single method to create spaceships and save them in array.
HumanShip.java - Contain the human ship class. 
RunnerShip.java - Contain the runner ship class.
AggressiveShip.java - This class implement a ship that pursues other ships and fire at them.
BasherShip.java - This class implement a ship that collide with other ships.
DrunkardShip.java - This class implement a ship that its pilot had a drink too much and every move is random.
SpecialShip.java - Ship that is doing the most operation except of teleport, and is able to reduce life from enemy.

=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented one abstract class that is SpaceShip.java, the others various ships are extensions from SpaceShip
So the other ships inhert the basic structure from the SpaceShip, and the difference between them is the doAction method, 
which each ship have different action each round so I made this method as abstract, same as- getImage method
(if we gonna want differen pictures for each ship in the future), Also I extend the API and add - actionEachRound method
that every round increase the energy of the ship, and count the delay rounds.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I implement the DrunkardShip the space ship that the turns is based on random basis, also the shooting is not really accurate.
and turn on the shield in probability of 0.5 and if distance is less then 0.5.
I implement the SpecialShip, this ship pursuer after the closet ship, and always accelerate also if the ship is too close to a enemy ship,
he will turn on the shield, and if the enemy is too close to the special ship he will decrease one life from this ship. and this is able to shoot.
